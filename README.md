This is Allison Kirste's repository for UP221 - Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science

I'm a first year MURP student at UCLA, with a concentration in climate, environment, and society. I completed my undergraduate degree at the university of washington in seattle, double majoring in law, societies & justice, and environmental studies. 

I'm mainly interested in urban climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, especially in the context of environmental justice, so hoping to do a final project related to that, but I'm also interested in food and utilities justice! I'm hoping to use this course to learn more about how to map environmental disparities. 

I don't have a lot of coding knowledge (aside from some very basic html), so this will definitely be a learning experience. I think that this will be a really useful skill to have throughout my graduate and professional career, though, and am excited to be able to use some of what I learn for my community organizing work as well!
